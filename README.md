# FiveM copy to clipboard
 This is one of my most useful releases <br>
## Usage:
Trigger the `sendToClipBoard` event (client) and you are done (start it too but you know how to do that (if you don't, then this resource is not made for you, move on) <br>
Example:
```lua
TriggerEvent('sendToClipBoard', 'this will get copied to the cliboard')
```
